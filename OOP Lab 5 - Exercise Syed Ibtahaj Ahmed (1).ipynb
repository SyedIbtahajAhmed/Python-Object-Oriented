    "1- In Football, players have different roles such as Striker, Defender, Mid Fielder and Goalie etc. Performance of each player must be judged according to its position. For instance, the performance of a goalie may be judged on the basis of his saves and not goals scored. Similarly, each player type has special areas where their performance must be judged. Using polymorpishm concepts, create a program where the Performance method can be used as an Abstract method. The program should be able to display performances of each type of player. You can set any attributes for each sub class."
